      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Why proof of work is essential to Bitcoin’s consensus and security model.</li>
        <li>How miners compete to add blocks and why the longest valid chain wins.</li>
        <li>What difficulty adjustments do and how they stabilize issuance.</li>
        <li>How proof of work ties real-world energy costs to digital scarcity.</li>

      <div>
        <h2>Why Bitcoin needs proof of work</h2>
        <p>Bitcoin is an open network where anyone can run a node or broadcast transactions. To prevent double-spending without a central authority, Bitcoin needs a way for nodes to agree on a single transaction history. Proof of work solves this by making it expensive to create blocks, so the chain with the most accumulated work represents the strongest consensus.</p>
        <p>In short: anyone can propose blocks, but only the chain that required the most real-world energy is accepted as the source of truth.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="callout note">
        <p class="callout-title">Quick definition</p>
        <p>Proof of work is a computational lottery where miners repeatedly hash block data until they find a valid result below the network target.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>How mining secures the ledger</h2>
        <p>Miners assemble transactions into blocks and compete to solve a hashing puzzle. The first miner to find a valid hash broadcasts the block. Other nodes verify the work, validate the transactions, and extend the chain. Each new block makes earlier blocks harder to replace because an attacker would need to redo the work for that block and every block that follows.</p>
        <h3>Longer chain = more work</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin does not choose the “longest” chain by block count alone—it chooses the chain with the most cumulative proof of work. This makes it costly to rewrite history and keeps consensus objective.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Difficulty adjustments and predictable issuance</h2>
        <p>Every 2,016 blocks, the network adjusts difficulty to keep the average block interval close to 10 minutes. When more hash power joins, difficulty rises; when hash power leaves, difficulty falls. This stabilizes issuance and maintains security even as mining hardware improves.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Incentives that keep the network honest</h2>
        <p>Miners earn new BTC (the block subsidy) plus transaction fees when they produce valid blocks. These rewards align miners with the health of the network. Attacking the chain would require massive energy costs and would undermine the value of the very asset miners are paid in.</p>
        <h3>Energy as a security budget</h3>
        <p>The energy spent on proof of work is not waste; it is the cost of keeping Bitcoin’s history tamper-resistant. It replaces the trust that would otherwise be placed in a central intermediary.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Why proof of work matters for Bitcoin</h2>
        <p>Bitcoin’s value proposition is a neutral, censorship-resistant monetary network. Proof of work is the mechanism that anchors that promise. It ensures that no single actor can arbitrarily rewrite the ledger, and it ties digital scarcity to physical resources.</p>
        <p>For everyday users, this means that transactions become final over time and that the 21 million BTC supply schedule can be enforced by anyone running a node.</p>
